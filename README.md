# JavaCode

I created these projects to help me learn java. 

While creating the Animal project I learned a lot about inheritance, image manipulation, 
access levels, polymorphism, and many other basic java concepts. 

I also wanted to learn about graphical user interfaces so I created a simple calculator and developted my 
understanding of action listeners and java swing components. 

My goal is to continue posting code while I learn more about Java. The purpose for this is to simply demonstate 
what I have learned.
